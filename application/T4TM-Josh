    <p>Greetings, my name is Joshua Stone. I'm the Front-End Lead for our team, T4 Milk Tea Team. I'm a student at San Francisco State University who's majoring in Computer Science. I plan to graduate this year, in December 2021. Some of my hobbies include: reading, anime, and cheesy reality TV shows like Survivor and The Amazing Race.</p>
